What features, if any, retain their importance at both low and high amounts of input data?
Comparing the results with lower and higher input data, the following features retains importance on both sets:
- Adverbs
- Past tense verbs
- First, second and third person pronouns

Explanation:
First adverbs are the most commonly used word type in English, there is no surprise to see adverbs ranked first.
And usually in Twitter you talked about things that just happened before that is why past tense verbs commonly occurred.
Lastly Twitter is a social media with a lot of interpersonal actions no wonder we see person pronouns quite often.
